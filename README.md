OpenShift - MediaWiki
=====================

This repository is designed to be used with https://www.openshift.com
applications.  To use, just follow the quickstart below.


Quickstart
==========

1. Create an account at https://www.openshift.com
2. Create a php application with mysql:

    ```bash
    $ rhc app create mediawiki php-5.4 mysql-5.5
    ```
3. Add this upstream mediawiki repo

    ```bash
    $ cd mediawiki
    $ git remote add upstream -m master git://github.com/openshift-quickstart/mediawiki-example.git
    $ git pull -s recursive -X theirs upstream master
    ```
4. Then push the repo upstream

    ```bash
    $ git push
    ```
5. That's it, you can now checkout your application at:
    http://mediawiki-$yourlogin.rhcloud.com
6. Default Admin Username: Admin
   Default Password: OpenShiftAdmin

Updates
=======

In order to update or upgrade to the latest mediawiki, you'll need to re-pull
and re-push.

1. Pull from upstream:

    ```bash
    $ cd mediawiki/
    $ git pull -s recursive -X theirs upstream master
    ```
2. Push the new changes upstream

    ```bash
    $ git push
    ```


Repo layout
===========
`php/` - Externally exposed php code goes here

`libs/` - Additional libraries

`misc/` - For not-externally exposed php code

`../data` - For persistent data

`.openshift/pear.txt` - list of pears to install

`.openshift/action_hooks/build` - Script that gets run every push, just prior to
    starting your app


Notes about layout
==================
Please leave php, libs and data directories but feel free to create additional
directories if needed.

Note: Every time you push, everything in your remote repo dir gets recreated
please store long term items (like an sqlite database) in ../data which will
persist between pushes of your repo.


pear.txt
===========

A list of pears to install, line by line on the server.  This will happen when
the user git pushes.
